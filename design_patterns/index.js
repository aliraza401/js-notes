// Design patterns::

// 3 types of design patterns:
//  Creational, Bheavirol, Structural

// Singleton::
// Object that can be created only once.
// Share a single global instance throughout our application.
// Singletons are classes which can be instantiated once, and can be accessed globally. 
// This single instance can be shared throughout our application, which makes Singletons great for managing global state in an application.

// Prototype: (Clone)
// inheretence from objects instead of class.
// Which is supported by javasctipt out of the box.

// Builder::
// Create object step by step using methods.(not once by using constructor)
// hotDog.addKetchup().addMustured().addSause();

// Factory::
// instead of using new keyword we used function to do this for us.

// Facade::
// simplified api to hide low lavel details of library.
// libs/

// Proxy::
// e.g: vue js reactivity

// Iterator::
// triverse throught item of data.

// Observer::
// subscribe to event that are emit by other object.
// firebase events, express routes

// Mediator::
// e.g: middleware in express
