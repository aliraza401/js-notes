// Database:
// structured collection of data and may be either physical or logical.

// DBMS:
// Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application for creating and administering databases.

// SQL (Structured Query Language):
// is a language used to manage data held in relational db.

// DB types:
// RDBMS, ORDBMS, ORDBMS, Graph, cloud.

// PK:
//  unique identifier, not null

// FK:
//  to establish a relationship between two tables. refer pk.

// Transaction:
// sequence of operations performed against a database. Ensure data integrity.

// Ensure data integrity:
// primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys, and data types.

// ACID:
// ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability).

// Normilization:
// reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity.
// 1st Normal Form (1NF): All columns have atomic values and no repeating groups.
// 2nd Normal Form (2NF): All non-key attributes are dependent on the whole key.
// 3rd Normal Form (3NF): No transitive dependencies exist. All columns depend on the primary key.
// Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): A higher version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.
// 4th Normal Form (4NF): A decomposition into tables having only simple multivalued dependencies.
// 5th Normal Form (5NF): Tables are decomposed into tables based onJoin Projection-Lattice.

// Index:
// Indexes are used to locate records quickly without having to search through the entire table.

// Referential integrity:
// set of rules that are enforced by the db to ensure that relationships between tables are maintained when data is inserted, deleted or updated.

// cursor:
// pointer used to iterate through the results of a database query.

// Transaction log:
// log is a record of all the changes that have been made to a database

// query optimization
// Process of tweaking a query to make it run more efficiently.
